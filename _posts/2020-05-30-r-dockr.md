<em>dockr</em> easy containerization for R:


minimal toolkit to build a lightweight Docker container image for your R package, in which the package itself is available. The Docker image seeks to mirror your R session as close as possible with respect to R specific dependencies. Both dependencies on CRAN R packages as well as local non-CRAN R packages will be included in the Docker container image.
