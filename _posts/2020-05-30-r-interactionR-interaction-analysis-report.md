interactionR: A Package for Full Reporting of Interaction Analyses

Produces a publication-ready table that includes all effect estimates necessary for full reporting effect modification and interaction analysis as recommended by Knol and Vanderweele (2012) [<doi:10.1093/ije/dyr218>]. It also estimates confidence interval for the trio of additive interaction measures using the delta method (see Hosmer and Lemeshow (1992), [<doi:10.1097/00001648-199209000-00012>]), variance recovery method (see Zou (2008), [<doi:10.1093/aje/kwn104>]), or percentile bootstrapping (see Assmann et al. (1996), [<doi:10.1097/00001648-199605000-00012>]).
