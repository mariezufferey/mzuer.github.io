The primary goal of the flair package is to provide tools for presenting R code.

It is common to show source code, in addition to code output, as part of a conference talk, workshop, or lecture. Often, we want to call attention to certain aspects of the code.


Facilitates easier formatting and highlighting of R source code in a R Markdown-based presentation. The main goal of the package is to allow users to preserve their code creation process within code chunks, then to specify formatting details for the source code, such as highlighting of particular syntactical elements.
