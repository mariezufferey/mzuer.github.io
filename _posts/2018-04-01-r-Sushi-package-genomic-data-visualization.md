</em>Sushi</em> package: genomic data visualization

https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/Sushi/inst/doc/Sushi.pdf

Sushi  is  an  R  package  for  plotting  genomic  data  stored  in  multiple  common
genomic  formats  including  bed,  bedpe,  bedgraph  format.   The  package  was
designed to be very flexible to allow for combinations of plots into multipanel
figures that can include plots made by Sushi, R basecode, or other R packages.
Sushi allows for simple flexible plotting of gene structures, transcript structures,
sequencing tracks, ChIP-seq peaks, chromatin interactions, GWAS results and
other commen genomic data types.  This vignette shows some examples of the
functions included in Sushi to get you started with plotting these diverse data
types.
