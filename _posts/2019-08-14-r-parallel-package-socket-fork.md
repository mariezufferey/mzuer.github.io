2 implementations of parallelism in the package <em>parallel</em>.

* <em>fork</em>: each parallel thread is a complete duplication of the master process with the shared environment, including objects or variables defined prior to the kickoff of parallel threads. Fast, but doesnâ€™t work on Windows.

* <em>socket</em>: each thread runs separately without sharing objects or variables, which can only be passed from the master process explicitly. Slower, but works on all operating systems.
