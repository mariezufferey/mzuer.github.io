ggstatsplot: 'ggplot2' Based Plots with Statistical Details

Extension of 'ggplot2', 'ggstatsplot' creates graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots themselves. It is targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community to provide a one-line code to generate information-rich plots for statistical analysis of continuous (violin plots, scatterplots, histograms, dot plots, dot-and-whisker plots) or categorical (pie and bar charts) data. Currently, it supports only the most common types of statistical tests: parametric, nonparametric, robust, and bayesian versions of t-test/anova, correlation analyses, contingency table analysis, meta-analysis, and regression analyses.
