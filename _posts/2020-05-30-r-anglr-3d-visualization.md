The anglr package is about data structures and 3D visualization.

Key aspects of data structures are:

* mesh-topology with a common vertex-pool for connected shapes.
* line segments.
* path-based geometry.
* triangulated surfaces.
* high-quality triangulations, meshes.
* relational vs. structural forms.
