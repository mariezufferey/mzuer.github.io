Let's retrieve an array

```
myArray=("$@") 
#or
myArray=( "one" "two" "three")
```

First possibility, if retrieved from command line:

```
for arg; do
   echo "$arg"
done
```

is equivalent to:

```
for arg in "${myArray[@]}"; do
   echo "$arg"
done
```

Another example:

```
for i in {1..100}; do
 echo $i
done
```

Similar to:

```
for ((i=1;i<=100;i++)); do 
   echo $i
done
```

With <em>seq</em>:

```
for i in $(seq 1 $END); do 
    echo $i; 
done
```

Using while:

```
c=1
while [[ $c -le 100 ]]; do 
   echo "$c"
   let c=c+1
done
```

```
```
